## weeklyur - Weekly User Report


### Manual operation:

```
# rooaws jpmc/<env>
# roossh roostify-core-ami
# cd roostify-core 
# dotenv rails c
```

- Copy/pasta vars and methods below, according to environment, to produce report delivered via email using SupportMailer function. 

- This will produce a receipt similar to this. Be aware this is not being sent via postfix so this will not be logged.

### To automate:

This could be automated by capturing in ruby script, including in roostify-core and running as scheduled task via cron. Report success/completion via logger / syslog.

- Just one of the SELECT statements below is different (dev: email as Username instead of
  sso_reference_id as Username). Fix this or use conditional? 
- SupportMailer.deliver_csv contains different args per environment

```
SupportMailer.deliver_csv("Chase Perf User Status Report", "mortgage_express_IO_Team@chase.com", "(chase_perf_user_report)-#{Time.current}", statement.run.to_csv).deliver_now
SupportMailer.deliver_csv("uat.asm User Status Report", "mortgage_express_IO_Team@chase.com", "(uat.asm user report)-#{Time.current}", statement.run.to_csv).deliver_now
SupportMailer.deliver_csv("Chase Production User Status Report", "mortgage_express_IO_Team@chase.com", "(chase_production_user_report)-#{Time.current}", statement.run.to_csv).deliver_now
SupportMailer.deliver_csv("dev.asm User Status Report", "mortgage_express_IO_Team@chase.com", "(New Date dev.asm)-#{Time.current}", statement.run.to_csv).deliver_now
```
